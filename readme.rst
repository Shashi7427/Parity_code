Welcome

This is my readme file for a project on parity violations
in the standard model.

This is Shashi's readme file for a project on parity 
violations in the standard model.

In the context of quantum physics, parity is a type of symmetric relation.

This is the change in the readme file after uploading of the file on the internet 
i.e. this is the file after the uploading on the github website.
